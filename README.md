This is my final project for a cybersecurity course.
This is a Bash automation that allows to perform attacks on a network from within, such as Password spraying, PSExec exploit Attack and remote control with evil-winrm. For each attack, a log is created so SOC teams can check themselves and see if the attack was discovered and when.
You need to be ROOT in order to run the script correctly.
